    "Over the past five decades, popular music lyrics have undergone systematic shifts in emotional tone, linguistic structure in lyrics, and thematic focus. Lyrical analyses of song lyrics indicate that popular music has become increasingly repetitive and simple, with an emphasis on individual experiences and self expression. These major changes along with an increase in the negative emotional language indicated by words associated with sadness, anger, loneliness, and stress. Researchers suggest that these trends in lyrics are a reflection of a broader picture of cultural and psychological shifts within society, such as rising awareness of mental health issues and increased societal stress. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quantitative studies using lage lyrical datasets, for our project, the Billboard charting songs and long term collection of popular music demonstrated consistent increases in first person pronouns in songs and more emotional negativity words and phrases. These findings help us strengthen the idea and hypothesis that music lyrics serve as a cultural artifact that mirrors the people, their emotional states and the social priorities of the society as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, prior research tells us that these long term trends are not uniform and they tend to shift during different periods of major disruption in society. For example, large-scale crises such as the September 112 attacks and during Covid 19 pandemic, the patterns in music  production, lyrical messages and listener preferences changed noticeably. Listeners often lean to music that can provide emotional comfort and relief from stress. \n",
    "\n",
    "We noticed that there are fewer studies that use consistent popularity-based datasets, like the U.S. Billboard Top 100, to directly compare crisis periods to immediately prior years, despite a wealth of evidence of long-term shifts in lyrical emotion. By investigating whether the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a visible shift from the long-term trend of rising negativity in popular U.S. pop music lyrics between 2000 and 2025, this project expands on previous research and continues to look at these patterns to find correlations between societal stress and music. \n",

    "We, as a group, hypothesize that the period from 2000 to 2025, mainstream U.S. pop music lyrics have become increasingly negative in sentiment and less semantically diverse overall. We further hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2021) is the reason for this temporarily disrupted this long-term trend, resulting in a relative decrease in negative sentiment or an increase in emotionally comforting lyrical content compared to the years immediately preceding the pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to our background research, there is a rise in negative emotional language and reduced lyrical complexity in popular music over history. However, many studies also show that during periods of societal stress and pressure, listeners tend to seek music that provides emotional relief or nostalgia to recall memories. Therefore, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to produce a measurable deviation from the long-term trend of increasing negativity in the lyrics. "

    "For the Dataset \n",
    "We plan to use a publicly available Kaggle dataset ((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ludmin/billboard) containing weekly Billboard Top 100 rankings from 1963 onward. This dataset includes song titles, artists, ranks, and chart weeks but does not include lyrics. To address this limitation, we will supplement the Billboard dataset with an external lyrics dataset obtained from a lyrics database or API. These two datasets combined will allow us to perform statistical analysis while getting accurate measures of song popularity and records. \n",

    "Instructions: Keep the contents of this cell. For each item on the checklist\n",
    "-  put an X there if you've considered the item\n",
    "-  IF THE ITEM IS RELEVANT place a short paragraph after the checklist item discussing the issue.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Items on this checklist are meant to provoke discussion among good-faith actors who take their ethical responsibilities seriously. Your teams will document these discussions and decisions for posterity using this section.  You don't have to solve these problems, you just have to acknowledge any potential harm no matter how unlikely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a [list of real world examples](https://deon.drivendata.org/examples/) for each item in the checklist that can refer to.\n",
    "\n",
    "A1 Informed Consent (x): We used publicly available data such as Billboard chart rankings, Spotify popularity metrics, and published song lyrics. Since we did not collect data directly from individuals and no private people can be identified in our dataset, informed consent is not applicable to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A2 Collection Bias (relevant): Our dataset intentionally focuses on mainstream U.S. pop music by sampling the top Billboard-charting songs each year. While this aligns with our research question, chart rankings reflect commercial success and industry promotion rather than the full diversity of musical expression. As a result, our findings describe trends in mainstream popular music consumption and should not be generalized to all genres, independent artists, or global music cultures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A3 Limit PII Exposure (x): The dataset contains only publicly released song lyrics and chart information. It does not include personal information such as contact details or private user data. As a result, risks related to exposing personal information are minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A4 Downstream Bias Mitigation (relevant): Our project looks at lyrical sentiment during major societal crises and discusses how music may reflect cultural mood or coping. There is a risk that our findings could be misinterpreted as statements about individual mental health or generational traits. To reduce this risk, we present our results as trends in mainstream music rather than direct measures of psychological well-being. We also avoid making claims about specific demographic groups because our dataset does not include information such as race or gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B1 Data Security (relevant): Even though our dataset is publicly available, we take steps to store it responsibly. The data are kept in secure university accounts and repositories. These practices help prevent unauthorized changes, accidental loss, or misuse of analyses related to sensitive societal events.\n",
    "\n",
    "B2 Right To Be Forgotten (x): Our dataset consists of publicly released lyrics and chart rankings and does not include personal data from private individuals. Because of this, the right to request removal of personal information does not apply to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "B3 Data Retention Plan (relevant): While the dataset contains public information and contains minimal privacy risk, we still aim to manage it responsibly. We plan to keep only the cleaned dataset and analysis code needed for reproducibility and delete temporary or duplicate files after the project is complete. This helps minimize unnecessary data storage while maintaining transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "C1 Missing Perspectives (relevant): We recognize that our analysis focuses on mainstream U.S. pop music, which may overlook independent, niche, or non-English songs. We have discussed our assumptions with peers and reviewed literature on cultural and societal trends to ensure our interpretations consider broader context and avoid overgeneralizing from our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "C2 Dataset Bias (relevant): Our dataset includes only top songs in the U.S., which reflects commercial popularity rather than the full diversity of music. We acknowledge that certain genres, independent artists, and non-English music are underrepresented, and we limit our conclusions to trends in mainstream pop.\n",
    "\n",
    "C3 Honest Representation (relevant): Our visualizations and summary statistics accurately reflect the underlying dataset. We avoid overstating trends and clearly indicate when changes are specific to mainstream pop music or linked to specific crises.\n",
    "\n",
    "C4 Privacy In Analysis (x): Our dataset contains only public song lyrics and chart metadata. No personally identifiable information is included, so privacy risks in the analysis are minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "C5 Auditability (relevant): We document all steps of data cleaning, evaluating lyrical sentiments, and other analysis, and store the dataset and code in repositories so that our results can be reproduced and verified if needed. Additionally, we plan to carefully review how Billboard determines the Top 100 each week, including how “listens” are counted across different platforms (streaming, CDs, etc.), to identify any groups that may be underrepresented. While we haven’t yet decided whether to include information about artists’ backgrounds (race, gender, etc.), we recognize that incorporating this could expand the project scope significantly, and we will carefully consider the ethical implications before including such data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "D1 Proxy Discrimination (relevant): Our analysis uses publicly available song lyrics and chart data, which do not include sensitive personal attributes. We have reviewed our variables (e.g., Billboard rank, weeks on chart, and lyrical sentiments) to ensure they do not serve as proxies for protected characteristics, and we avoid drawing conclusions about individual artists or demographic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "D2 Fairness Across Groups (relevant): Since our project focuses on overall trends in mainstream U.S. pop music, we do not make predictions about individual artists or demographic groups. However, we are aware that certain genres, artist types, and underrepresented groups may not be fully captured in our dataset, and we frame all findings in terms of mainstream pop music trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "D3 Metric Selection (relevant): We use multiple metrics to evaluate lyrical trends, including sentiment scores (how positive/negative the lyrics are) and measures of lexical diversity (how varied the lyrical vocabulary is). This allows us to capture different aspects of the lyrics and avoid drawing conclusions based on a single metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "D4 Explainability (relevant): Our analysis methods, including sentiment evaluation and lexical diversity calculations, are transparent and straightforward. We document how each metric is calculated and present results in ways that are interpretable to stakeholders and readers without technical expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "D5 Communicate Limitations (relevant): We clearly communicate the limitations of our analysis, including the focus on mainstream U.S. pop music, potential underrepresentation of certain artists or genres, and the fact that sentiment scores are an approximation of lyrical tone rather than a measure of actual listener emotions. These limitations are highlighted in our reports and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "E1 Monitoring And Evaluation (x): Our project analyzes historical data and does not involve a live system or predictive model. Therefore, ongoing performance monitoring is not applicable. However, we document all analysis steps carefully so that the process can be reviewed or audited if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "E2 Redress (x): Since our work does not interact with users or produce real-time outputs, there is no risk of harm to individuals that would require a redress plan. We acknowledge that misinterpretation of results is possible, and we mitigate this by clearly communicating the scope and limitations of our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "E3 Roll back (x): We do not have a deployed model in production, so there is no need for a rollback mechanism. All analysis is conducted offline using static datasets, and results are fully documented and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "E4 Unintended Use (relevant): While our project does not involve a live deployed model, there is a possibility that others could misinterpret our findings (for example, claiming that negative lyrics indicate individual mental health trends). To prevent misuse, we clearly communicate that our results reflect trends in mainstream U.S. pop music and emphasize the limitations of the dataset and analysis.\n"
