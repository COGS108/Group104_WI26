    "\n",
    "Over the past five decades, popular music lyrics have undergone systematic shifts in emotional tone, linguistic structure in lyrics, and thematic focus. Lyrical analyses of song lyrics indicate that popular music has become increasingly repetitive and simple, with an emphasis on individual experiences and self expression. These major changes along with an increase in the negative emotional language indicated by words associated with sadness, anger, loneliness, and stress. Researchers suggest that these trends in lyrics are a reflection of a broader picture of cultural and psychological shifts within society, such as rising awareness of mental health issues and increased societal stress. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quantitative studies using lage lyrical datasets, for our project, the Billboard charting songs and long term collection of popular music demonstrated consistent increases in first person pronouns in songs and more emotional negativity words and phrases. These findings help us strengthen the idea and hypothesis that music lyrics serve as a cultural artifact that mirrors the people, their emotional states and the social priorities of the society as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, prior research tells us that these long term trends are not uniform and they tend to shift during different periods of major disruption in society. For example, large-scale crises such as the September 112 attacks and during Covid 19 pandemic, the patterns in music  production, lyrical messages and listener preferences changed noticeably. Listeners often lean to music that can provide emotional comfort and relief from stress. \n",
    "\n",
    "We noticed that there are fewer studies that use consistent popularity-based datasets, like the U.S. Billboard Top 100, to directly compare crisis periods to immediately prior years, despite a wealth of evidence of long-term shifts in lyrical emotion. By investigating whether the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a visible shift from the long-term trend of rising negativity in popular U.S. pop music lyrics between 2000 and 2025, this project expands on previous research and continues to look at these patterns to find correlations between societal stress and music. \n",

    "We, as a group, hypothesize that the period from 2000 to 2025, mainstream U.S. pop music lyrics have become increasingly negative in sentiment and less semantically diverse overall. We further hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2021) is the reason for this temporarily disrupted this long-term trend, resulting in a relative decrease in negative sentiment or an increase in emotionally comforting lyrical content compared to the years immediately preceding the pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to our background research, there is a rise in negative emotional language and reduced lyrical complexity in popular music over history. However, many studies also show that during periods of societal stress and pressure, listeners tend to seek music that provides emotional relief or nostalgia to recall memories. Therefore, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to produce a measurable deviation from the long-term trend of increasing negativity in the lyrics. "

This dataset includes song titles, artists, ranks, and chart weeks but does not include lyrics. To address this limitation, we will supplement the Billboard dataset with an external lyrics dataset obtained from a lyrics database or API. These two datasets combined will allow us to perform statistical analysis while getting accurate measures of song popularity and records. \n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",

For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
